#Description

# Best-Cats-WebApp  was built using the Cat API https://api.thecatapi.com/

Cat API is A public service API all about Cats. In this repository, it is the API for this application.
The Best Cat concept is designed to provide families with the information needed on the different types of breeds to decide the best Breed of cat that would be suitable for a family when getting a cat.

#How it works
It populates the Next page button with https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds and Requests a row of 6 new Images with https://api.thecatapi.com/images/search?breed_id={{selected_breed.id}} when you click following pages. This then shows another six random Images for that Breed.
